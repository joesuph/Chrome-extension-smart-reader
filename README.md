# Chrome Extension Smart Reader
This is a chrome extension built with the goal of reading any website with speech synthesis in the desired way with easy user setup. Other readers when met with a twitter feed might read information that we aren't interested in hearing such as the date of tweet. With this extension, a user can highlight the text of a tweet they want to be read, (or the entire tweet including date and all), click start in the extension menu and each tweet text will be read that matches the one selected.
